## [1.1.0] — 2026-03-24

### Added
- **Perceptual Design Defaults** — science-backed lookup tables in `SKILL.md` for typography (letter spacing, line height, line length), color contrast, spacing scale, motion (duration, easing), and icon sizing. Claude uses these automatically when building components.
- **Onboarding flow** (`onboarding.md`) — guided first screen builder. One question, preflight MCP check, then Claude scaffolds and screenshots a real screen in Pencil in under 2 minutes. 8 tool calls max.
